## 📦 Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The codebase follows a component-based architecture using React. It adopts the Redux state management pattern for managing the application state. Firebase is used for authentication and interacting with the database. The codebase also utilizes React Router for routing between different pages.Overall, the architecture is well-structured and adheres to the best practices of modern web development.    |
| **📃 Documentation**   | The codebase lacks comprehensive documentation. While some code files include brief explanations of their functionalities, code comments are minimal. There is a need for better documentation, especially for complex components and functionalities. Regularly updating and maintaining the documentation would greatly assist future developers in understanding the code and making modifications.     |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The codebase relies on multiple external libraries and frameworks. Notable dependencies include React, React Router, Redux Toolkit, Firebase, and FullCalendar. These libraries offer a wide range of functionalities and simplify development processes. However, some dependencies may require periodic updates to ensure compatibility and security. Make sure to monitor updates and maintain the proper versions of the dependencies to avoid any potential issues.   |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase is organized into smaller, manageable components. Each component focuses on a specific feature or functionality, making it easier to understand, maintain, and reuse. Proper file structures and naming conventions are employed to improve modularity. However, some components could benefit from further modularization to reduce complexity and tightly coupled code.    |
| **🧪 Testing**          | The codebase lacks explicit testing strategies and tools. Integration and unit tests are not included in the repository. Implementing testing frameworks such as Jest and Enzyme would facilitate the creation and execution of tests. Incorporating test suites that cover crucial features and edge cases would enhance the overall stability and reliability of the application.   |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | It is challenging to evaluate the system's performance without detailed metrics or benchmarks. However, React's virtual DOM rendering and Redux state management contribute to an efficient rendering process. As the codebase grows, optimizing UI rendering through techniques like memoization and effective data retrieval from the database can further improve performance. Regular profiling and performance analysis are recommended.     |
| **🔐 Security**        | The codebase demonstrates some security measures through the use of Firebase authentication. However, without a detailed code analysis, it is difficult to ascertain the exact security measures implemented. Attention should be given to ensuring proper access control, securely storing user credentials, validating and sanitizing user inputs, preventing code injection attacks, and implementing appropriate database rules. Conducting security audits and continuous monitoring is crucial. |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The codebase utilizes Git for version control, utilizing features like branches, commits, and pull requests to manage changes and collaboration. However, it is essential to encourage adherence to best practices for branch management, commit messages, and review processes. Regular code reviews and adherence to branching strategies (e.g., GitFlow) aids in maintainability and facilitates smooth collaboration.   |

The ModalAddEvent component is rendered in a portal when "Add event" button is clicked.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [FormRepetitive.jsx](https://github.com/K3nK0/Planning-employes/blob/main/src/layouts/profile/FormRepetitive.jsx) | This code imports various dependencies and defines a functional component for a form. It handles form submission by creating multiple events based on the specified start date, end date, interval, and other inputs. The events are then added to a Firebase Firestore collection. The component also updates the state and dispatches actions to update the Redux store.                                                                                           |
| [ModalAddEvent.jsx](https://github.com/K3nK0/Planning-employes/blob/main/src/layouts/profile/ModalAddEvent.jsx)   | This code snippet is a React component that renders a modal for adding events. It contains two radio buttons to select the frequency of the event (unique or repetitive). Based on the selected choice, it renders the respective form component (FormUnique or FormRepetitive). It also receives props for closing the modal and employee ID.                                                                                                                       |
| [FormUnique.jsx](https://github.com/K3nK0/Planning-employes/blob/main/src/layouts/profile/FormUnique.jsx)         | This code is a functional component that handles the form for adding a new event. It uses React and Redux for state management. The form inputs are controlled through useState hooks. When the form is submitted, the event data is sent to a Firebase Firestore collection. The dispatched action updates the Redux store with the new event. After the event is successfully added, the employee's events are fetched again using the getEventsEmployee function. |

| [Login.jsx](https://github.com/K3nK0/Planning-employes/blob/main/src/pages/Login.jsx) | This code is a React component that handles user login functionality. It uses the Firebase authentication service to sign in a user with their email and password. If the login is successful, it dispatches an action to update the user's connected status and redirects them to the management page. The component renders a login form if the user is not already connected. |
